# Yet Another Data Grid  

Yet another data grid ... but why for god's sake? Basically because we needed a data grid for our project that can be grouped by column content, such as the same date, same amount/value, same operator, same project, etc., and then collapse all affected rows into a single expandable row. 
Since we were not able to find something suitable, "Yet Another Data Grid" was born. :upside_down_face:  

# What is collapsible_data_grid 

The collapsible_data_grid was designed to be easy to use while offering a wide range of possibilities for those who want to explore its full potential. However, as aforementioned, the main intention was to offer expandable rows and accompanied with that mechanism, an automatic and efficient method to determine such row candidates and automatically _collapse_ them to a single row.
