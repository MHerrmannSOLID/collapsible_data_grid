Additional features backlog:
- removing the requirement that rows have the exact same compareable type (e.g. all numbers or all strings)
  cuz then data types can be mixed in the same row but however the should be strict regarding the columns.
- make the table more adaptive to the screen size changes
  - having priorities for columns so that some columns are hidden when the screen size is small
  - adding a min size for the columns so that the will be a scroll bar when the screen size is small
- since compareable is already implemented, sorting is also a quick feature to add
